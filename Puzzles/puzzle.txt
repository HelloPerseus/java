Hello, its me
it's me again 
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
do u wanna go over everything with me
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
like we were in California just like how we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
but there's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I wanna call u and tell u im sry
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, its me
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I feel so sry
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
after me, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart. Hello........
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
